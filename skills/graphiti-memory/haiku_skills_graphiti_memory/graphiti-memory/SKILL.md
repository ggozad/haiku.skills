# Graphiti Memory

Use the **remember** tool to store facts, observations, and context into the knowledge graph.
Use the **recall** tool to search the knowledge graph for relevant memories.
Use the **forget** tool to remove outdated or incorrect memories.

## Workflow

1. Use `remember` to store important information as it comes up.
2. Use `recall` to retrieve relevant context before answering questions.
3. Use `forget` to clean up memories that are no longer accurate.

## Guidelines

- Store information that might be useful for future conversations.
- Be specific when recalling — use targeted queries rather than broad ones.
