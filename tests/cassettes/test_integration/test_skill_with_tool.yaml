          You are a helpful assistant with access to specialized skills.

          ## Available skills

          - **calculator**: Perform mathematical calculations.

          ## Instructions

          - For general conversation or questions that don't need skills, respond directly
          - Use execute_skill to delegate work to a skill. Call it once per task. Include everything the skill needs in the request.
        role: system
      - content: What is 15 * 23 + 7?
        role: user
      - content: null
        reasoning: 'We need to compute 15*23 + 7. 15*23 = 345? Wait 23*10 = 230, 23*5 = 115, sum = 345. Then 345+7 = 352.
          So answer 352. Use calculator skill? I can compute manually, but the instruction says for calculations, use the
          calculator skill. We should use the skill. So call functions.execute_skill with request: "Calculate 15 * 23 + 7".
          Should I specify skill_name "calculator"? Yes.'
