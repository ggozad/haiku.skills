          You are a focused execution agent. Complete the following task using the skills and instructions provided.

          ## Task

          Summarize the following text into concise bullet points: Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence that enables systems to learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed. It focuses on developing algorithms that can access data and use it to learn for themselves.

          ## Skill instructions

          # Summarizer

          You are a text summarization assistant. When given text:

          1. Identify the key points
          2. Condense them into concise bullet points
          3. Preserve the essential meaning
          4. Return a markdown bulleted list

          ## Guidelines

          - Follow the skill instructions carefully
          - Stay focused on the specific task described above
          - Provide a clear, complete result

            - Il permet aux systèmes d'apprendre et de s'améliorer grâce à l'expérience sans programmation explicite.
            - Il se concentre sur la création d'algorithmes qui accèdent aux données et apprennent de ces dernières de façon autonome.

            Check: "Machine learning" = "apprentissage automatique" or "apprentissage machine". French usage often "apprentissage automatique". "Subset" = "sous-ensemble" maybe but "sous-catégorie" or "branche". Use "sous-ensemble" but "sous-ensemble de l'IA" fine. "It lets systems learn and improve from experience" = "Il permet aux systèmes d'apprendre et de s'améliorer à partir de l'expérience". "without explicit programming" = "sans programmation explicite". "focuses on creating algorithms that access data and learn from it autonomously" = "se concentre sur la création d'algorithmes qui accèdent aux données et apprennent de celles-ci de façon autonome." That's good. Let's produce three bullet points.

            learn and improve from experience without explicit programming.  \n- It focuses on creating algorithms that access
            data and learn from it autonomously.  \n\n**French Translation**\n\n- L'apprentissage automatique est une sous-catégorie
            de l'intelligence artificielle.  \n- Il permet aux systèmes d'apprendre et de s'améliorer à partir de l'expérience
            sans programmation explicite.  \n- Il se concentre sur la création d'algorithmes qui accèdent aux données et apprennent
            de ces dernières de façon autonome."
