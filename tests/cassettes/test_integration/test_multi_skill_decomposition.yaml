It focuses on developing algorithms that can access data and use it to learn for themselves."

            We need to summarize, then translate to French.

            We have to use specialized skills: summarizer and translator. We can orchestrate using _orchestrate with request string? The request may include multiple steps: summarize then translate. We can orchestrate to do that. So we will call orchestrate with a request that instructs summarizer then translator. Likely the orchestrator can handle pipeline. Alternatively, do in two steps: first call summarizer, then translator. But we want to provide a single answer.

            Thus we need to delegate to orchestrator. Use the tool: _orchestrate. Provide request with: "Summarize the text below: [text]. then translate the summary to French."

            We call the orchestrator.

          You are a task planning agent. Your job is to analyze a user request and decompose it into subtasks that can be handled by available skills.

          ## Available skills

          - **simple-skill**: A simple test skill that does basic operations.
          - **skill-with-refs**: A skill with references, metadata, and all optional fields.
          - **summarizer**: Summarize text into concise bullet points.
          - **translator**: Translate text between languages.

          ## Instructions

          Given the user's request, create a plan by:
          1. Identifying which skills are relevant to the request
          2. Breaking the request into subtasks, each assigned to one or more skills
          3. Keeping it simple: if the request can be handled by a single skill, create a single task

          Each task must have:
          - A unique id (starting from "1")
          - A clear description of what needs to be done
          - A list of skill names to use (from the available skills above)

          Provide brief reasoning for your decomposition.

            The user wants to summarize the text, then translate the summary into French. We need to do both: first produce summary, then French translation. Provide only summary? The instruction: "Please summarize the following text: [text]. Then translate the summary into French." So output should likely be the summary and then its translation.

            But the skill says: "Translate the summary into French." Not necessarily ask for summary and translation separately? It's to translate the summary. But they ask "Then translate the summary into French." So output should be the translated summary. Wait reading: "Please summarize the following text: ... Then translate the summary into French." We must produce translation. They may want the translation of the summary. Possibly want both? The wording ambiguous. They say "Then translate the summary into French." So step 1: produce summary, step 2: translate that summary into French. Final answer should be French translation. Might be also good to include the summary in English? The instruction says "Please summarize the following text: [text]. Then translate the summary into French." So maybe they want the summary and the French translation. I'd give both. But the system instruction says "Return only the translated text" from translator skill. But the developer instruction: "Translate the summary into French." And system: "When given text and a target language: ... Return only the translated text". So as per translator skill, we focus only on translation, but we need to identify source language. The source language is English. The summary presumably in English? That step is part of the conversation, but translator skill expects input text to translate. The user wants the summary then translation. The conversation: "Please summarize... Then translate the summary into French." Likely we need to do summary, then translation. But the translator skill is only concerned with translation. So maybe we output the French translation of the summary.

            Hence produce: "L'apprentissage automatique est une sous-catégorie de l'intelligence artificielle qui permet aux systèmes d'apprendre et de s'améliorer grâce à l'expérience sans être explicitement programmés. Il se concentre sur le développement d'algorithmes qui peuvent accéder aux données et les utiliser pour apprendre de manière autonome." But that's translation of original text, not exactly summary. Wait summarizing first: The summary might be: "Machine learning allows systems to learn from data, improving without explicit programming." That's concise. Then French translation: "L'apprentissage automatique permet aux systèmes d'apprendre à partir des données, s'améliorant sans programmation explicite."

            Thus final answer: French translation only. Let's output just that.

            We need to summarize into concise bullet points. Then translate summary into French. So present summary bullet points in English, then French translation bullet points. Probably two lists. Use markdown bulleted list. Maybe separate sections.

            Let's produce bullet points: "Machine learning subfield of AI; learns from data; improves autonomously; requires algorithms that access data to learn." That's concise.

            Then French version. Let's do:

            English bullet list

            - Machine learning is a subfield of artificial intelligence that enables systems to learn from experience.
            - It relies on algorithms that can access and process data to improve performance.
            - The goal is to let systems autonomously improve without explicit programming.

            French bullet list.

            Should I separate with headings? Use "English Summary:" bullet list then "Résumé en français:" bullet list. Let's comply.

            We need to provide a summarized version (likely in bullet points concise), and also the summary in French. The assistant was given subtask results that provide two bullet point summaries in English and French, and a translation. The "Task 1" English bullet points: three bullets. French summary: also three bullets. Task 2 translation: "L’apprentissage automatique permet aux systèmes d’apprendre à partir des données, s’améliorant sans programmation explicite." However, they also gave the French summary from task 1.

            The best approach: provide the summary in English (bullet points?), and then translation in French (could be bullet points or sentence). The instruction: "Please summarize the following text..." Then "Then translate the summary into French." So we can give the summary as bullet points, then the translation (maybe as a paragraph but could also be bullet). Let's be consistent: We'll provide English bullet points (3). Then French translation: bullet points identical to those. Or give translation as a paragraph. The subtask 1 gave bullet points in French, which could be used.

            Thus final answer: Provide bullet summary in English, then a short French translation (maybe a paragraph). Ensure it's coherent.

            Let's produce:

            Summary (English):

            - Machine learning is a branch of AI that lets systems learn from experience without explicit programming.
            - It focuses on algorithms that access data to self-learn.
            - The goal is to improve performance autonomously.

            Translation (French):

            - L’apprentissage automatique est une branche de l’intelligence artificielle qui permet aux systèmes d’apprendre de l’expérience sans programmation explicite.
            - Il met l’accent sur des algorithmes qui accèdent aux données pour apprendre de façon autonome.
            - L’objectif est d’améliorer les performances sans intervention humaine directe.

            Alternatively, we can use the summary sentence: "L’apprentissage automatique permet aux systèmes d’apprendre à partir des données, s’améliorant sans programmation explicite."

            Make sure to not mention subtasks. OK.

          You are a helpful assistant with access to specialized skills.

          ## Available skills

          - **simple-skill**: A simple test skill that does basic operations.
          - **skill-with-refs**: A skill with references, metadata, and all optional fields.
          - **summarizer**: Summarize text into concise bullet points.
          - **translator**: Translate text between languages.

          ## Instructions

          - For requests that require specialized skills, use the orchestrate tool to delegate the work
          - For general conversation or questions that don't need skills, respond directly
        role: system
      - content: 'First summarize the following text, then translate the summary to French: Machine learning is a subset of

          The user: "First summarize the following text, then translate the summary to French: Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence that enables systems to learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed. It focuses on developing algorithms that can access data and use it to learn for themselves."

          We need to summarize, then translate to French.

          We have to use specialized skills: summarizer and translator. We can orchestrate using _orchestrate with request string? The request may include multiple steps: summarize then translate. We can orchestrate to do that. So we will call orchestrate with a request that instructs summarizer then translator. Likely the orchestrator can handle pipeline. Alternatively, do in two steps: first call summarizer, then translator. But we want to provide a single answer.

          Thus we need to delegate to orchestrator. Use the tool: _orchestrate. Provide request with: "Summarize the text below: [text]. then translate the summary to French."

          We call the orchestrator.
