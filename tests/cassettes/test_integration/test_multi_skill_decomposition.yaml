            We need to perform two tasks in sequence: summarize and translate to French. We have a summarizer skill and translator skill. We should call the summarizer first, then translator. The instruction: "Use execute_skill to delegate work to a skill. Call it once per task." So need two separate calls. Probably call summarizer and then translator with that result. We'll need to provide request strings accordingly. Let's craft first call: summarizer with text. Then second call: translator with summary. We'll output the final French translation. In these interactions, we might chain? But per instruction, each skill call separate. So we send first skill. The assistant must output only the skill call? Actually the conversation is: user asks. We respond accordingly. We need to produce function call. We can chain? We might need to call summarizer, get result, then call translator. But we can't get back the summarizer output within same turn unless we manage? Usually we can embed function call as one to summarizer with request, and skill returns summary; we then do translator. But the conversation might need to wait for function responses. Might need two separate messages: first call summarizer, then after we get summary we call translator. But as per spec, we should respond to user directly. The best is to perform summarization and translation in one go, but using skills. Since we can only call one skill per turn, maybe we need to do summarizer and translator sequentially across turns. But we can call summarizer first; after it returns summary, we use translator.

            But question: "First summarize the following text, then translate the summary to French." So we need final French output. We can't just produce calls. But we can do summarizer then translator. Suppose we call summarizer. After that returns summary, we call translator with that summary as the request.

            Probably the system expects us to call summarizer, then translator. So we produce two function calls in sequence. The conversation could be:

            Assistant: call summarizer skill.

            Then in response, we get summary. Then we call translator.

            But it's ambiguous. But we can combine into one response: call summarizer, then call translator with placeholder? No.

            Better: call summarizer first, get summary. We'll then call translator. So we need to send two function calls in two messages. Let's do it. We'll call summarizer with "request" containing text. Then after the skill returns summary string, we call translator. We can simulate this. The system will handle function calls. So let's produce first function call.

            We need to translate that summary into French. The summary consists of three bullet points. The translation should preserve original meaning and tone. No extra commentary. Output only translated text. Let's translate:

            - Machine learning is a branch of artificial intelligence that allows systems to learn and improve from experience without explicit programming.
            => "L'apprentissage automatique est une branche de l'intelligence artificielle qui permet aux systèmes d'apprendre et de s'améliorer à partir de l'expérience sans programmation explicite."

            - It centers on creating algorithms that can access and process data to learn on their own.
            => "Il se concentre sur la création d'algorithmes capables d'accéder et de traiter des données pour apprendre de manière autonome."

            - The key capability is autonomous learning and self‑improvement driven by data.
            => "La capacité clé est l'apprentissage autonome et l'amélioration autonome alimentés par les données."

            Check consistency: use "automatique" as in French "apprentissage automatique". Also "self‑improvement" -> "amélioration autonome" or "auto-amélioration". "driven by data" -> "alimenés par les données". Could be "développés par les données" but "alimentés par". "self‑improvement" maybe "auto-amélioration" but likely "autonome" used: "l'apprentissage autonome et l'amélioration autonome alimentés par les données." Might double use of "autonome" but okay.

            Better: "L'apprentissage automatique" is used; French uses "l'apprentissage automatique".

            Second: "Il se concentre sur la création d'algorithms qui peuvent accéder et traiter des données afin d'apprendre de façon autonome." could be "Il se concentre sur la création d'algorithmes capables d'accéder et de traiter des données pour apprendre par eux-mêmes." Let's keep "apprendre de façon autonome".

            Third: "La capacité clé est l'apprentissage autonome et l'auto-amélioration alimentés par les données." That seems best.

            Thus translation:

            - L'apprentissage automatique est une branche de l'intelligence artificielle qui permet aux systèmes d'apprendre et de s'améliorer à partir de l'expérience sans programmation explicite.
            - Il se concentre sur la création d'algorithmes capables d'accéder et de traiter des données pour apprendre de façon autonome.
            - La capacité clé est l'apprentissage autonome et l'auto-amélioration alimentés par les données.

            Return only that.

The instruction: "Use execute_skill to delegate work to a skill. Call it once per task." So need two separate calls. Probably call summarizer and then translator with that result. We'll need to provide request strings accordingly. Let's craft first call: summarizer with text. Then second call: translator with summary. We'll output the final French translation. In these interactions, we might chain? But per instruction, each skill call separate. So we send first skill. The assistant must output only the skill call? Actually the conversation is: user asks. We respond accordingly. We need to produce function call. We can chain? We might need to call summarizer, get result, then call translator. But we can't get back the summarizer output within same turn unless we manage? Usually we can embed function call as one to summarizer with request, and skill returns summary; we then do translator. But the conversation might need to wait for function responses. Might need two separate messages: first call summarizer, then after we get summary we call translator. But as per spec, we should respond to user directly. The best is to perform summarization and translation in one go, but using skills. Since we can only call one skill per turn, maybe we need to do summarizer and translator sequentially across turns. But we can call summarizer first; after it returns summary, we use translator.

          But question: "First summarize the following text, then translate the summary to French." So we need final French output. We can't just produce calls. But we can do summarizer then translator. Suppose we call summarizer. After that returns summary, we call translator with that summary as the request.

          Probably the system expects us to call summarizer, then translator. So we produce two function calls in sequence. The conversation could be:

          Assistant: call summarizer skill.

          Then in response, we get summary. Then we call translator.

          But it's ambiguous. But we can combine into one response: call summarizer, then call translator with placeholder? No.

          Better: call summarizer first, get summary. We'll then call translator. So we need to send two function calls in two messages. Let's do it. We'll call summarizer with "request" containing text. Then after the skill returns summary string, we call translator. We can simulate this. The system will handle function calls. So let's produce first function call.

            The user wants: first summarize the text, then translate the summary to French. So they need a summary, then a French translation of it. We can do both in simple response. We don't need a skill because summarization and translation are simple tasks.

            We are allowed to respond directly. So let's provide a concise summary first, then the French translation. Use a bullet summary? They say "summarize" without formatting. We'll provide a concise sentence summary: "Machine learning lets systems improve based on data without explicit programming" Then translate: "L'apprentissage automatique permet aux systèmes de s'améliorer à partir des données sans programmation explicite."

            We can do the translation. No skill needed.
